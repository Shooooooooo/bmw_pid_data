# BMW PID Data Project

This project provides structured C header files containing BMW engine PID (Parameter ID) data, auto-generated from CSV data sources. The PID data was originally sourced from [thesecretingredient.neocities.org/bmw/](https://thesecretingredient.neocities.org/bmw/). It is designed to help developers and engineers integrate, analyze, or visualize BMW engine diagnostic data in C or C++ projects.
To send a PID request, refer to "Sample BMW Enhanced PID Request" from the website.
